/* This file defines an ARP cache, which is made of two structures: an ARP
   request queue, and ARP cache entries. The ARP request queue holds data about
   an outgoing ARP cache request and the packets that are waiting on a reply
   to that ARP cache request. The ARP cache entries hold IP->MAC mappings and
   are timed out every SR_ARPCACHE_TO seconds.

   Pseudocode for use of these structures follows.

   --

   # When sending packet to next_hop_ip
   entry = arpcache_lookup(next_hop_ip)

   if entry:
       use next_hop_ip->mac mapping in entry to send the packet
       free entry
   else:
       req = arpcache_queuereq(next_hop_ip, packet, len)
       handle_arpreq(req)

   --

   The handle_arpreq() function is a function you should write, and it should
   handle sending ARP requests if necessary:

   function handle_arpreq(req):
       if difftime(now, req->sent) >= 1.0
           if req->times_sent >= 5:
               send icmp host unreachable to source addr of all pkts waiting
                 on this request
               arpreq_destroy(req)
           else:
               send arp request
               req->sent = now
               req->times_sent++

   --

   The ARP reply processing code should move entries from the ARP request
   queue to the ARP cache:

   # When servicing an arp reply that gives us an IP->MAC mapping
   req = arpcache_insert(ip, mac)

   if req:
       send all packets on the req->packets linked list
       arpreq_destroy(req)

   --

   To meet the guidelines in the assignment (ARP requests are sent every second
   until we send 5 ARP requests, then we send ICMP host unreachable back to
   all packets waiting on this ARP request), you must fill out the following
   function that is called every second and is defined in sr_arpcache.c:

   void sr_arpcache_sweepreqs(struct sr_instance *sr) {
       for each request on sr->cache.requests:
           handle_arpreq(request)
   }

   Since handle_arpreq as defined in the comments above could destroy your
   current request, make sure to save the next pointer before calling
   handle_arpreq when traversing through the ARP requests linked list.
